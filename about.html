			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</div>Hi there. My name is Mary Holmes and I am a UX designer currently working at Amazon.com.
			<p>Before focusing on UX design, I was a print design ranging in different disciplines: logo and icon design, business collateral, and exhibit design, to name a few. Which means I’ve been in the design industry for over 20 years! Time flies when I’m having fun. What I love about all of my experiences is the collaboration between cross-functional team members or clients with a start-up mentality. I am energized with learning new areas of business and creating engaging and delightful design solutions that solve everyday problems. I’ve had the pleasure to work with many companies in different fields ranging from leading edge technology companies, a notable game company, home builders, and small design firms focussing on small to medium size businesses. What all these companies have in common are a passion for what they are doing and who they are doing it for.
			<p>When I’m not at work, I love to camp, run, garden, and above all photography. I’m an iPhone photo addict (to everyone’s annoyance around me) and love to play with the Hipstamatic app.</p>
			<p>Thank you for viewing my site.</p>
